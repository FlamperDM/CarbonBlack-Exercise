#### Exercise to do:

- Implement an object that has methods called ‘Push’ and ‘Pop’.  This object should be able to handle having integer values passed to Push and should be able to give back an integer value from Pop in “stack order” (i.e. Last in First out - LIFO).

- Now implement an object or extend the previous object to implement methods called ‘Queue’ and ‘Dequeue’.  This object should also be able to handle integer values passed to Queue and should be able to give back an integer value from Dequeue in “queue order” (i.e. First In, First Out - FIFO).

- Implement a Stack using only Queue

- Implement a Queue using only Stack
